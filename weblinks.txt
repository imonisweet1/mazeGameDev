The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !

You don’t have to do the tasks in order, except for the first one (obviously), or if a task depends on a previous one

You have a link to a very good and very long tutorial about raycasting in the Tips and links section below, so read it very carefully, and practice !

Please have a lot of fun doing this project !
